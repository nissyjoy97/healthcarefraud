Healthcare fraud is a significant issue in the United States, causing substantial financial losses and affecting the integrity of the healthcare system. This project done as part of the coursework for "IDS 575 Machine Learning" aims to detect potentially fraudulent healthcare providers based on their claims data using machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of inpatient, outpatient, beneficiary, and provider data, which were combined for predictive modeling. Various machine learning models, including Na√Øve Bayes, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Non-Linear SVM, and Logistic Regression, were implemented and evaluated for their performance on metrics like AUC and F1-score. The Logistic Regression model achieved the best accuracy of 91.25%, showing promise in identifying potential fraud providers. However, further improvements are required to enhance the model's sensitivity and reduce misclassifications. This report provides valuable insights and lays the foundation for future research in healthcare fraud detection.
